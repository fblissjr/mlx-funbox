# mlx-funbox
mlx and mlx-lm CLI toolbox for my own personal use, and maybe yours too

pipe in whatever you like to cohere's model (or something else). haven't tested tool use with the updated tokenizer fix.

example usage: ```cat fun.txt | python fff.py "Summarize" --temp 0.0 --model ./mlx-community_c4ai-command-r-plus-4bit```
